// They pick a number and check to see if it is a power of 2. If it is, they divide it by 2. If not, they reduce it by the next lower number which is a power of 2. Whoever reduces the number to 1 wins the game. Louise always starts.

// Given an initial value, determine who wins the game.

// Example
// n=132
// It's Louise's turn first. She determines that 132 is not a power of 2. The next lower power of 2 is 128, so she subtracts that from 132 and passes 4 to Richard.  4 is a power of 2, so Richard divides it by 2 and passes 2 to Louise. Likewise, 2 is a power so she divides it by 2 and reaches 1. She wins the game.

// Update If they initially set counter to 1, Richard wins. Louise cannot make a move so she loses.
