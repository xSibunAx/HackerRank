# The absolute difference between two integers, a and b, is written as |a-b|. The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, elements, is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in __elements.

# The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array (elements) for storing N non-negative integers, and a public integer (maximumDifference) for storing the maximum absolute difference.

# Task
# Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

# A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the __elements instance variable.
# A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in __elements and stores it in the maximumDifference instance variable.

# You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The locked Solution class in the editor reads in 2 lines of input. The first line contains N, the size of the elements array. The second line has N space-separated integers that describe the __elements array.
